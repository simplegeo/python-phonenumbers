Description: Python port of Google's library for parsing phone numbers.
 This library provides parsing/formatting/validating of phone numbers
 for all countries/regions of the world.
 - gets the type of the number based on the number itself; able to
   distinguish Fixed-line, Mobile, Toll-free, Premium Rate, Shared
   Cost, VoIP and Personal Numbers (whenever feasible).
 - gets a confidence level on whether two numbers could be the same.
 - provides valid example numbers for all countries/regions, with the
   option of specifying which type of example phone number is needed.
 - quickly guessing whether a number is a possible phonenumber by
   using only the length information, much faster than a full
   validation.
 - full validation of a phone number for a region using length and
   prefix information.
 - formats phone numbers on-the-fly when users enter each digit.
 - finds numbers in text input.
 - provides geographical information related to a phone number.
